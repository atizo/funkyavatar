What is funkyavatar?
--------------------

It is an avatar image creation script written in Python that draws
funky avatars for given (email-)hashes.

If you don't like identicon (too algorithmic) or wavatar/monsterid
(too childish), funkyavatar is for you!

How does it look like?
----------------------

Check out the example images in the source directory.



How does it work?
-----------------

It uses three different shapes that are colored, moved and rotated
depending on the given hash. One shape is colored, the other two are
gray.

The shapes are stored as SVG paths, so feel free to draw new ones
and play...



How can I use it?
-----------------

You need to install python-cairo and python-pyparsing and add funkyavatar to
your PYTHONPATH.

Then use it like this:

################################################################################
from funkyavatar import FunkyAvatar
import hashlib

size = 200
email = 'asdf@asdf.com'

a = FunkyAvatar(size)

hash_value = hashlib.md5(email).hexdigest()
a.generate(hash_value)

a.save_png('avatar.png')
################################################################################
